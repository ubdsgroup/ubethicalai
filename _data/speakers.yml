  talktitle: AI and Stories of Autonomous Landscapes 
  talkabstract: Part myth, part imaginary, part reality, there are numerous visions of how AI is changing the landscape around us. Yet these ideas have a longer historyâ€”one that directly implicates architects and architecture back to the 1960s. In this talk, Molly Wright Steenson traces the history of AI in architecture and looks ahead to its contemporary and future implications.

  talktitle: Code Should Not Be Law Checks and Balances in Human-machine Systems
  talkabstract: Autonomous systems, smart contracts on block chains, and even social networks encode decisions and ethical policies that they impose on their users and their environments. This talk will present analysis of some cases where abdicating the responsibility of ethical decisions and delegating them to software resulted in measurable problems. I will also discuss instances where systems are designed to have built-in mechanisms for humans to monitor, and sometimes override, their decisions. The (somewhat subjective) conclusion the talk will lead into is that human-intervention has to be built into any system that impacts a large enough organization or the environment.

  talktitle: Moral Machines - The Ethical Dilemmas of Self-Driving Cars
  talkabstract: With the rapid approach of self-driving cars, we are poised to yield autonomy to millions of machines that will have the power over life and death. The road to this future has a bright promise, but as we are beginning to see, there are numerous psychological roadblocks. Many of these involve thorny ethical challenges that come when the moral decisions that are today made by individual drivers are turned over to preprogrammed algorithms. How should these cars be programmed to mete out risks to the various people on road? Who determines the ethics of these algorithms? I will discuss the recent work with my collaborators on the social psychology and legal implications of these moral machines.
