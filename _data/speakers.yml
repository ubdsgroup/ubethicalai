  talktitle: AI and Stories of Autonomous Landscapes 
  talkabstract: Part myth, part imaginary, part reality, there are numerous visions of how AI is changing the landscape around us. Yet these ideas have a longer historyâ€”one that directly implicates architects and architecture back to the 1960s. In this talk, Molly Wright Steenson traces the history of AI in architecture and looks ahead to its contemporary and future implications.
