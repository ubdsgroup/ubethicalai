# Use this website as a template for your academic research group

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and uses some [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) and  [Bootswatch](http://www.bootswatch.com). We tried to make it simple yet adaptable, so that it is easy for you to re-use it for your purpose. 

### Getting started
All pages are written in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for easy editing, and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) uses Liquid for the data-driven pages. The publicaion list, news items, and group members are stored as `.yml` data sheets (plain text) in the `_data folder`, so that one can update the website easily. The pages are in the `_pages` folder. Updating and maintaining is easy using [Github](http://www.github.com) (not worldpress-easy, but there are other advantages (see e.g. [this](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/), or [this](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2015/11/jekyll-against-the-rest-of-the-world/)). [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) takes all the markdown and data files, and creates beautiful `html` files in the `_site` folder.

If you never used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), read the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)) article and check out [their website](https://jekyllrb.com). Same for [Github](http://www.github.com), which will host your first website draft.
